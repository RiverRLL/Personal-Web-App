        <p>About Me: My name is River and I am a grade 11 student at Western Tech. My goals for the future are to graduate from high school and study at university in the feild of Business or Tech.
            Some of my intrests include sports, technology, reading, and spending time with my two cats, Shilo and Shadow. I have learned how to code in Java, HTML, and CSS in the ICS3U Course, and this is my culminating project, a portfolio showcasing my work.

        My Work: 
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
    <a>
        <a href= "https://github.com/RiverRLL/Personal-Web-App">GUI App (TriviaGame) </a>: I worked with Peyton to create a trivia app called TriviaGame. The purpose of the app is to quiz users on their knowledge of 4 different catagories: Math, Science, History, and Music.
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    How to use: 1. Choose a catagory by selecting the number that corresponds with the catagory. 2. Select the answer you think is correct from the 4 options. 3. Once you get the correct answer you will get a message conforming the answer and the game will be over.
</p>
</div>
</div>
    <p>
    Next steps: I plan to add aditional catagories such as sports or movies, as well as more trivia questions for each catagory. I also intend to seperate the questions into 3 different difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

    <p>
        <a href= "https://github.com/RiverRLL/ICS3U-Culminating">Culminating App (StockSim) </a>: I created an app in java called "StockSim" which is a simulation of the stock market. Within the app there are 4 stocks that experience price movment similar to stocks on the stock market. The purpose of the app is to provide users with a simulated stock market to practice investing/trading or to use as a game for recreation.
    </p>
</div>

</div>
<p>
    How to use: 1. To add money to your account you can click the "ADD $500" button within the "Wallet" menu. 2. You can also view you balance and the total value of your stocks from the "Wallet Menu". 3. To buy stocks simpily click on a stock of your choice within the "Buy" menu to purchase a share. 4. To sell stocks you can click on a stock you own within the "Sell" menu to sell one share. 5. You may also click the "Sell All" button to sell every stock you own. 6. You can short a stock by selling a stock you do not own.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Next steps: My next step to upgrade StockSim is to add significantly more stocks to provide more variety and and a more thorough experience for the user. My end goal for the app is to eventualy integrate historical or even live data from the stock market to get the most realistic stock market experience.
